# 0x18. C - Dynamic libraries

# Tasks
0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions listed below:

int _putchar(char c);
int _islower(int c);
int _isalpha(int c);
int _abs(int n);
int _isupper(int c);
int _isdigit(int c);
int _strlen(char *s);
void _puts(char *s);
char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
int _atoi(char *s);
char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);
char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);
char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);
If you haven’t coded all of the above functions create empty ones, with the right prototype.
Don’t forget to push your main.h file in your repository, containing at least all the prototypes of the above functions.

1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

2. Let's call C functions from Python
I know, you’re missing C when coding in Python. So let’s fix that!

Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python. See example for more detail.

3. Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!
I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?
